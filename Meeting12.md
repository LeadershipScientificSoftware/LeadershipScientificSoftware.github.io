## Meeting 12

**Time:** Thursday, May 18, 2023, 3 - 4:30 pm ET

**Topic:** Promoting inclusive and equitable research: Town hall discussion with seed projects and ECP Broadening Participation Initiative

**Description:** Collaborating to address urgent challenges in workforce recruitment and retention in the computing sciences is a critical aspect of work in the DOE community.  Work is needed to expand diversity and stable career paths, while fostering a community and culture that attract and retain new generations of scientists and research software engineers.  In this meeting, representatives from the six seed projects, as well as from the [ECP Broadening Participation Initiative](https://www.exascaleproject.org/hpc-workforce/), will participate in a panel discussion.

In opening remarks, the panelists will briefly describe their project's plan for promoting inclusive and equitable research (PIER plan), as well as provide an update on work in three complementary thrusts of the ECP Broadening Participation Initiative.


Panelists, their affiliations, and seed project titles are:

- Anshu Dubey, Argonne National Lab, _COLABS: Collaboration of Oak Ridge National Lab, LBNL, and ANL for Better Software_
- Rafael Ferreira da Silva, Oak Ridge National Lab, _Center for Sustaining Workflows and Application Services_
- Lois Curfman McInnes, Sandia National Labs, _PESO: Toward a Post-ECP Software-Sustainability Organization_
- Terry Jones, Oak Ridge National Lab, _STEP: Sustainable Tools Ecosystem Project_
- Keita Teranishi, Oak Ridge National Lab, _S4PST: Sustainability for Node Level Programming Systems and Tools_
- Gregory Watson, Oak Ridge National Lab, _Open Scientific Software Foundation_

In opening remarks each panelist will briefly describe their seed project.  Discussion will continue with questions and answers.

**Why attend:** To learn about preliminary work and plans to address workforce challenges in DOE computing sciences; to share your insights about challenges, best practices, and opportunities for advancing diversity, equity and inclusion in the DOE computing sciences workforce.
