## Leadership Scientific Software Town Hall Meetings

### Background

The ECP Software Technology (ST) focus area received a recommendation during its February 2021 Independent Project Review to work with DOE program managers on developing a software sustainability plan.  As part of this effort, ECP ST is hosting a series of town hall events to engage the broader scientific software community, both to describe our software efforts in ECP and to establish dialogue with the broader scientific software community.  We hope that the discussions during the town hall events will lead to improved understanding of sustainability, and the challenges and opportunities for improving it.

- **Who may attend:** We welcome anyone who will respectfully engage in the discussion
- **Format:** Monthly 90-minute virtual meetings via Zoom using Zoom registration
- **Schedule:** Third Thursday each month from 3 - 4:30 pm ET
