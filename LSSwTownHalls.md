## Leadership Scientific Software Town Hall Meetings

### Background

The ECP Software Technology (ST) focus area received a recommendation during its February 2021 Independent Project Review to work with DOE program managers on developing a software sustainability plan.  As part of this effort, the ECP ST leadership team is hosting a series of town hall events to engage the broader scientific software community, both to describe our software efforts in ECP and to establish dialogue with the broader scientific software community.  

ECP ST has created a curated leadership software portfolio called E4S, [e4s.io](https://e4s.io).  In addition, we have established a macro-engineering software lifecycle, tool base and communication platforms that address the planning, execution, tracking and assessing of the portfolio.  

As a community, we intend to transition ECP ST approaches and E4S to a sustainable state as we go beyond the end of ECP.

We hope that the discussions during the town hall events will lead to improved understanding of sustainability, and the challenges and opportunities for improving it.
