In opening remarks, panelists briefly address the following questions from their perspective:
- In the past few years, how have we improved the development and sustainable delivery of leadership scientific software?
- What are the most important impediments to further improvement?
- What do you see as the most urgent priority activities in planning for a sustainable leadership software ecosystem over the next few years?
- What is missing from the conversation about sustainable leadership scientific software?

**Why attend:** To discuss the progress, impediments, priorities and gaps in leadership scientific software.
