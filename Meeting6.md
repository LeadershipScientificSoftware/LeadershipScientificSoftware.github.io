In opening remarks, panelists briefly address the following questions from their perspective:
- What is the value proposition of your ecosystem to its developer and user communities?
- What is the business model of your ecosystem (how do people fund their efforts)?
- What are some of the challenges you face in providing value?
- What are your sustainability challenges?

**Why attend:** To discuss the experience, opportunities and challenges of technical software ecosystems present in other scientific communities.
