**Topic:** Expanding Funding Agency and Industry Collaborations: A Panel Discussion

**Description:** The open-source scientific software community benefits from complementary and leveraged contributions, from universities, laboratories, and industry.  Many open-source software products receive research and development funding from research funding agencies.  While agencies expect high-quality software capabilities from their sponsored work, sustaining successful products and supporting users outside a research team's target user community are typically difficult to prioritize or justify solely with agency funding.  As a result, agency and industry partnerships are essential for obtaining optimal value from these products.  Numerous partnerships are already in place but more opportunities exist, The cost of making high-quality scientific software libraries and tools has decreased due to widely used tools and platforms such as GitHub, and the need for high-quality software ecosystems has increased due to growing scientific demands and increased interconnection between scientific disciplines.  The importance of collaboration in sustaining and leveraging agency and industry investments is even more important as we go forward.

In this panel discussion, we bring industry and agency community members together to explore how we can further improve the ability of industry to leverage, and complement agency-sponsored software capabilities so that the whole scientific community can realize the benefits of new software capabilities as they emerge.

This month our panelists are:

- TBD

In opening remarks, panelists briefly address the following questions from their perspective:
- Has research funding (primarily to labs and universities) been effectively leveraged and complemented by industry investments?
- What has worked and not worked well with past leverage and complementarity efforts?
- What are some near-term opportunities to improve leverage and complementarity?
- What are some long-term opportunities and constraints on leverage and complementarity?


**Why attend:** To discuss the feasibility, strategies, and opportunities for improved leverage and complementarity of agency and industry.
