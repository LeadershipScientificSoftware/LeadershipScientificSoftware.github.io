## About Leadership Scientific Software
We define Leadership Scientific Software to be libraries, tools and environments that contribute to scientific discovery and insight in new and emerging computing environments. The focus of these capabilities is to push the boundary of feasibility, enabling larger scale, higher fidelity and greater integration of advanced computing ecosystems.

## LSSw Town Hall Meetings
The US Department of Energy is sponsoring a series of [town hall meetings](LSSwTownHalls.md) to discuss the development and sustainable delivery of leadership scientific software.
