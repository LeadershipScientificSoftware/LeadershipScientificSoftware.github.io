# Leadership Scientific Software (LSSw) Portal

*The LSSw portal is dedicated to building community and understanding around the development and sustainable delivery of leadership scientific software*

## Background
The US Department of Energy (DOE) Exascale Computing Project (ECP) is developing many of the important enabling technologies required for obtaining functionality and performance on upcoming exascale computers.  As part of this effort, the ECP Software Technology (ST) focus area has established a macro-engineering software lifecycle to plan, execute, track, and assess product development toward the delivery of a curated portfolio of reusable, open-source software products called the *Extreme-scale Scientific Software Stack* or E4S[https://e4s.io].

During the final years of ECP, one key objective is to transition to a sustainable organization and model for continued development and delivery of future capabilities, including incorporation of new scientific software domains, and expansion of the contributor community. 

This [LSSw portal](https://lssw.io) is dedicated to supporting communication and community building toward the sustainable development and delivery of *Leadership Scientific Software*.

## A Working Definition of Leadership Scientific Software
We define Leadership Scientific Software to be libraries, tools and environments that contribute to scientific discovery and insight in new and emerging computing environments. The focus of these capabilities is to push the boundary of feasibility, enabling larger scale, higher fidelity and greater integration of advanced computing ecosystems.

## Join the Conversation
we are providing several venues for people interested in learning about and contributing to the LSSw conversation.  Please use the following links to connect with this community:
- [LSSw.io:](https://lssw.io) The LSSw.io website (which presently redirects to the site LeadershipScientificSoftware.github.io) is the main portal for the LSSw community.
- [LSSw Town Hall Meetings:](LSSwTownHalls.md)  The Exascale Computing Project (ECP) Software Technology (ST) leadership team is sponsoring a series of town hall meetings to discuss the development and sustainable delivery of leadership scientific software.
