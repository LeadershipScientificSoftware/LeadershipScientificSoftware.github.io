**Description:** On October 29th, 2021, the US Deparment of Energy Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) released a Request for Information (RFI) on the stewardship of software for scientific and high-performance computing. The RFI detailed the potential scope of stewardship activities, including but not limited to: training on software development and use, workforce support, infrastructure for common development needs, curation and governance processes, maintaining situational awareness, shared engineering resources, and project support.  ASCR received [37 independent responses](https://doi.org/10.2172/1843576) by the December 13, 2021 deadline. 

In this open discussion, we welcome LSSw community members to bring forward questions and comments related to the RFI responses.
