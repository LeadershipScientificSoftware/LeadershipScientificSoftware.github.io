## PESO Background

The PESO Project is led by the leadership team from the US Department of Energy (DOE) Exascale Computing Project (ECP) Software Technology (ST) Focus Area, and by the key technical leaders of the [Spack](https://spack.io) project, the [E4S](https://e4s.io), and the Software Development Toolkits (SDKs).

As part of ECP efforts, we have facilitated the efforts of about 250 scientists from DOE labs, universities, and partner commercial software companies to create a first-of-a-kind software ecosystem for scientific software sponsored by DOE. The team has also been heavily involved in the [IDEAS Project](https://ideas-productivity.org), the [Better Scientific Software (BSSw)](https://bssw.io) project, Sustainable Research Pathways (SRP), and more, as part of creating a vibrant community around the productive and sustainable creation and use of software to advance scientific discovery in service of the DOE mission.

PESO intends to participate in the extension and expansion of software-ecosystem sustainment as ECP comes to and end, toward the continuation of the success that ECP has started.
