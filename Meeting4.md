## Meeting 4

**Time:** Thursday, January 20, 2022, 3 - 4:30 pm ET

**Topic:** Expanding the Leadership Scientific Software Developer and User Communities: A panel discussion

**Description:** This month we have panelists representing the broader scientific software developer communities:
- [Deb Agarwal](https://dst.lbl.gov/~deba/), Berkely Lab
- [Anshu Dubey](https://www.anl.gov/profile/anshu-dubey), Argonne National Laboratory
- [Bill Hart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-e-hart-3691134/), Sandia National Labs
- [Addi Malviya-Thakur](https://csmd.ornl.gov/profile/addi-malviya-thakur), Oak Ridge National Laboratory
- [Katherine Riley](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/about/people/katherine-riley), Argonne National Laboratory

In opening remarks, panelists briefly address the following questions from their perspective:
- What are some important similarities and differences between the software development and use in your community relative to large-scale HPC environments such as the DOE Leadership Computing Facilities (LLNL, OLCF, ALCF, NERSC)?
- Do you think it makes sense to include your scientific software community as part of what we mean by Leadership Scientific Software?
- If so, what is most important to consider if we attempt to expand the definition of leadership computing to include the community you represent? If not, why?
- What are some issues in the HPC software community that are not being sufficiently addressed right now that need to be considered to better address your important requirements?

**Why attend:** To discuss the potential expansion and limits of leadership scientific software beyond high-performance computing.
