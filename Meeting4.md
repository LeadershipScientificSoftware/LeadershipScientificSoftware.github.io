## Meeting 4

**Time:** Thursday, December 16, 3 - 4:30 pm ET

**Topic:** Expanding the Leadership Scientific Software Developer and User Communities: A panel discussion

**Description:** This month we have panelists representing the broader scientific software developer and user communities:
- [Anshu Dubey](https://www.anl.gov/profile/anshu-dubey), Argonne National Laboratory
- Others TBD

In opening remarks, panelists briefly address the following questions from their perspective:
- What are some important similarities and differences between the software development and use in your community relative to large-scale HPC environments such as the DOE Leadership Computing Facilities (LLNL, OLCF, ALCF, NERSC)?
- Do you think it makes sense to include your scientific software community as part of what we mean by Leadership Scientific Software?
- If so, what is most important to consider if we attempt to expand the definition of leadership computing to include the community you represent? If not, why?
- What are some issues in the HPC software community that are not being sufficiently addressed right now that need to be considered to better address your important requirements?

**Why attend:** To discuss the potential expansion and limits of leadership scientific software.
